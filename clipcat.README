With i3 and xclip it will only remember one copy and there is no list
All you need to know to get started is in the readme in the package
It was a bit complicated to configure but to help you can say you should start
with the default config and not the one from the readme, like this command:
clipcat-menu default-config > .config/clipcat/clipcat-menu.toml
