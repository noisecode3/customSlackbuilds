CDM is a minimalistic, yet full-featured replacement for display managers like SLiM, SDDM and GDM
that provides a fast, dialog-based login system without the overhead of the X Window System.
Written in pure bash, CDM has almost no dependencies, yet supports multiple users/sessions
and can start virtually any desktop environment or window manager.
